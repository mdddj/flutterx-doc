## 📝 Translation Guidelines

When translating the remaining files, please:

1. **Maintain formatting**: Keep all markdown formatting, code blocks, and image references
2. **Preserve technical terms**: Keep technical terms like "FlutterX", "Dio", "Freezed", etc.
3. **Translate UI elements**: Translate button names, menu options, and interface text
4. **Keep code examples**: Translate comments in code but keep the code itself unchanged
5. **Update internal links**: Ensure links point to English versions where available

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Translate the high-priority files (dart-file, pubspec, assets modules)
2. **Priority 2**: Translate other feature documentation
3. **Priority 3**: Complete index files and placeholder content
4. **Final step**: Review and test all translations for consistency

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total files**: ~44 markdown files
- **Fully translated**: ~15 files (34%)
- **Renamed & configured**: ~29 files (66%)
- **Remaining content translation**: ~29 files

The infrastructure is 100% complete - all that remains is content translation!
